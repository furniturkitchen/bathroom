Wiring Diagram For Fog Lights Without Relay School Cool Electrical From old-school-new-body–review.blogspot.com
Switch that you turn on the fog lights from the cabin is not designed for the current that consumes fog lights 2 * 40w/12v = about 7a. The relay can perform several functions. I bought the kuryakyn master cylinder switch. However, some folks wire up the lights using the same wiring that fed those low power backup bulbs in the factory tail light housing and they use the backup switch in the transmission to.

<p>A relay is an electrical component that can control the flow of electricity in a circuit. In this video we look at how relays work, why they are a good idea, and how to install them in your vehicle. A relay may be used, instead of a switch, to control a light. This allows the relay to open and close.</p>
