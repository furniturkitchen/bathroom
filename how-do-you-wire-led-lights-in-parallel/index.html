Wiring Diagram For Lights In Series From wiringdiagramall.blogspot.com
When you wire in series, you add the forward voltages of each led in the circuit but the current fed to each led remains the same. Installing 12v led lights is a fairly simple process. Switches to each led will be ok, just choose proper voltage and current. Installing 12v led lights is a fairly simple process.
